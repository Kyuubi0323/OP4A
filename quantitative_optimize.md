# ACUITY Quantitative Accuracy Optimization

When quantizing with ACUITY, the model accuracy is slightly lost, but if the accuracy loss is too large and does not meet the needs of the current project, you can use Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) quantization or mixed quantization.

If the model accuracy is not satisfied, you can use the KLD quantization algorithm to quantify the model first, and then check whether the accuracy is satisfied.

## Quantization Using KLD

To use KLD quantization, you can add the following options in `pegasus_quantize.sh`:

```shell
cmd="$PEGASUS quantize \
    --model         ${NAME}.json \
    --model-data    ${NAME}.data \
    --iterations    ${Q_ITER} \
    --device        CPU \
    --with-input-meta ${NAME}_inputmeta.yml \
    --rebuild  \
    --model-quantize  ${NAME}_${POSTFIX}.quantize \
    --quantizer ${QUANTIZER} \
    --qtype  ${QUANTIZED}  \
    --algorithm kl_divergence \
    --batch-size 100 \
    --divergence-first-quantize-bits 12
    --MLE"
```

- `--algorithm kl_divergence` — set up KLD quantization
- `--divergence-first-quantize-bits` — set up a $2^{12}$ KLD histogram box
- `--batch-size` — set the number of quantitative inputs for the model
- `--MLE` — optional; if the quantization accuracy using KLD is still not compliant, use this option to achieve higher accuracy, but it will increase the quantization time

## Mixed Quantification

The purpose of hybrid quantization is to use data types with higher precision for specific layers in the specified model and lower data types for other layers to ensure the accuracy of the final result. If the accuracy of a quantized model cannot meet the requirements and cannot be improved by co-quantization (such as KLD quantization), then hybrid quantization can be used to avoid loss of accuracy.

## Mixed Quantification Examples

Taking the `uint8` quantization of `MobileNetV2_ImageNet` in the previous section as an example, this model directly uses ACUITY to quantize `uint8` and has a significant loss of accuracy compared to the floating-point model.

**MobileNetV2_ImageNet** — compare the results of the floating-point model after direct quantization by uint8:

### Statistics: Layers Requiring Mixed Quantization

Add the `--compute-entropy` parameter to the quantization script `pegasus_quantize.sh`:

```shell
cmd="$PEGASUS quantize \
    --model         ${NAME}.json \
    --model-data    ${NAME}.data \
    --iterations    ${Q_ITER} \
    --device        CPU \
    --with-input-meta ${NAME}_inputmeta.yml \
    --rebuild  \
    --model-quantize  ${NAME}_${POSTFIX}.quantize \
    --quantizer ${QUANTIZER} \
    --qtype  ${QUANTIZED}  \
    --compute-entropy"
```

**X86 Linux PC**
```shell
# pegasus_quantize.sh MODEL_DIR QUANTIZED ITERATION
pegasus_quantize.sh MobileNetV2_Imagenet uint8 10
```

When the quantization script `pegasus_quantize.sh` is executed, the following files are generated:

- `MODEL_DIR_QUANTIZE.quantize` — contains data for the quantization model, where the layers in `customized_quantize_layers` are automatically counted for layers that need to be used for mixed quantization.
- `entropy.txt` — records the entropy value of each layer in this quantization. The higher the entropy value, the lower the quantification accuracy. The range is `[0, 1]`.

Users can refer to the values in `entropy.txt` to add, delete, or modify the layers in `customized_quantize_layers` within `MODEL_DIR_QUANTIZE.quantize`.

### Execute the Hybrid Quantization Command

> **Tips:** When `pegasus_quantize.sh` is executed, the full quantization command will be printed at the top. Replace `--rebuild` with `--hybrid` to run hybrid quantization.

**X86 Linux PC**
```shell
python3 ~/acuity-toolkit-whl-6.30.22/bin/pegasus.py quantize \
    --model MobileNetV2_Imagenet.json \
    --model-data MobileNetV2_Imagenet.data \
    --iterations 1 \
    --device CPU \
    --with-input-meta MobileNetV2_Imagenet_inputmeta.yml \
    --hybrid \
    --model-quantize MobileNetV2_Imagenet_uint8.quantize \
    --quantizer asymmetric_affine \
    --qtype uint8 \
    --compute-entropy
```

After the command is executed, the ACUITY Model Weights file (`.data`) is updated, and a new ACUITY Model Structure file (`quantize.json`) is generated.

## Mixed Quantification Results

After performing the hybrid quantization, use `pegasus_inference.sh` for inference on the uint8 mixed quantization model.

> Because the model structure changes after mixed quantization, please first modify the `--model` parameter in `pegasus_inference.sh` to point to the new `quantize.json` file.

**X86 Linux PC**
```shell
# pegasus_inference.sh MODEL_DIR QUANTIZED ITERATION
pegasus_inference.sh MobileNetV2_Imagenet/ uint8
```

The inference output result is:

```
I 04:00:10 Iter(0), top(5), tensor(@attach_Logits/Softmax/out0_0:out0) :
I 04:00:10 812: 0.9987972974777222
I 04:00:10 404: 0.0001131662429543212
I 04:00:10 814: 6.176823808345944e-05
I 04:00:10 627: 4.6059416490606964e-05
I 04:00:10 833: 4.153002373641357e-05
```

The hybrid quantization model now has the highest confidence level of `812` with a confidence of `0.998` in the Top 5 results, which is consistent with the floating-point model results — proving that the mixed quantization uint8 model has successfully reduced the loss of model accuracy.

Next, you can continue with NPU deployment to compile and export the model. Because the model structure changes after mixed quantization, use the `quantize.json` file generated by mixed quantization as the `--model` parameter when performing model conversion.
